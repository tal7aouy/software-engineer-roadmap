### Cryptography Learning Roadmap with Challenges

#### Phase 1: Cryptography Fundamentals
1. **Concepts to Learn**
   - What is cryptography?
   - Core principles: confidentiality, integrity, authenticity.
   - Basic terms: plaintext, ciphertext, cipher, key, encryption, decryption.

2. **Challenge to Build**
   - **Simple Encryption/Decryption Program**: Write a script that encrypts and decrypts a message using a simple cipher (like Caesar or substitution). 
   - **Extend It**: Add input validation and custom encryption logic to improve security.

#### Phase 2: Hashing Algorithms
1. **Concepts to Learn**
   - What is hashing?
   - Common hashing algorithms: MD5 (deprecated), SHA-1 (deprecated), SHA-256, SHA-3.
   - Hashing applications: password storage, data integrity checks, digital signatures.

2. **Challenges to Build**
   - **Password Hashing System**: Create a system that hashes passwords and verifies them for a simple login.
   - **Add Security**: Implement salting to prevent dictionary attacks and use a strong hash algorithm like SHA-256 or SHA-3.
   - **File Integrity Checker**: Build a program that generates a hash for a file and checks it later to verify integrity.
   - **Enhance with HMAC**: Create an HMAC-based data integrity checker to ensure message authenticity.

#### Phase 3: Symmetric Cryptography
1. **Concepts to Learn**
   - Symmetric encryption and decryption: block ciphers vs. stream ciphers.
   - Common symmetric algorithms: AES, 3DES, DES (deprecated).
   - Modes of operation: ECB, CBC, GCM.
   - Key management and key rotation.

2. **Challenges to Build**
   - **File Encryption System**: Write a script that encrypts and decrypts files using a symmetric cipher (AES).
   - **Secure Messaging App**: Build an app that encrypts messages with a shared key. Use CBC mode with a random initialization vector (IV) for added security.
   - **Improve with GCM**: Implement AES-GCM mode to add authentication to the encrypted messages.

#### Phase 4: Asymmetric Cryptography
1. **Concepts to Learn**
   - Asymmetric encryption: public and private key pairs.
   - Common asymmetric algorithms: RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), Diffie-Hellman, DSA.
   - Applications: digital signatures, secure key exchange.

2. **Challenges to Build**
   - **Public/Private Key Generation**: Create a script that generates a public/private key pair using RSA or ECC.
   - **Secure Key Exchange System**: Build a system that uses Diffie-Hellman to securely exchange keys between two parties.
   - **Secure File Transfer System**: Write a program that encrypts files with a recipient's public key for secure transmission.

#### Phase 5: Random Number Generation and Secure Practices
1. **Concepts to Learn**
   - Importance of randomness in cryptography.
   - Sources of randomness in different operating systems (e.g., /dev/random, /dev/urandom in Linux).
   - Use cases: generating session keys, OTP (One-Time Password) generation.

2. **Challenges to Build**
   - **Secure OTP Generator**

   - **Secure OTP Generator**: Create a program that generates a secure One-Time Password (OTP) for user authentication, using a secure random number generator (e.g., Java's `SecureRandom`).
   - **Implement Security Measures**: Add mechanisms like rate limiting and OTP expiration to prevent misuse and ensure security.
   - **Randomized Token System**: Build a system that generates random tokens for session management. Implement checks to ensure tokens are unpredictable.

#### Phase 6: Advanced Cryptography and Common Mistakes
1. **Concepts to Learn**
   - Common cryptographic mistakes to avoid (e.g., rolling your own cryptographic algorithms, poor key management, using weak or deprecated algorithms).
   - Importance of centralized cryptographic management.
   - Understanding real-world cryptographic vulnerabilities and attacks.

2. **Challenges to Build**
   - **Secure an Existing System**: Take an open-source project with known security flaws, identify the vulnerabilities, and apply cryptographic solutions to secure it.
   - **Document Improvements**: Document the changes made to secure the system, explaining the rationale behind each modification.
   - **Create a Cryptographic Library**: Build a reusable library of cryptographic functions with proper documentation and unit tests.
   - **Ensure Key Security**: Implement a key management system to ensure secure storage and distribution of cryptographic keys. Include measures like key rotation and key expiration.
